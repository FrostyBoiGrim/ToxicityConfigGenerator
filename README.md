# ToxicityConfigGenerator
Have you ever wanted to be toxic in TF2, but randomly? Do you not want to spend 2 days making the scripts yourself?
Now you can, with the power of Toxicity Randomizer 2.0 and its python executable Toxicity Config Generator!

# What Does It Do?
Toxicity Randomizer is a set of TF2 config files that allow you to perform a randomly chosen taunt or put a randomply chosen message in chat at the push of a single button! Its never been easier to flex multiple unusual taunts or to simply bring variety to your evil actions.
The Toxicity Config Generator is a python based gui that helps you customize and create the config files in order for you to maximize your time being toxic. Through it you can control which class gets which taunts, and add as many messages as you want to the random message pool.

# How Does It Work?
Toxicity Randomizer generates its randomness in the same way many classic video games did, player input. A set list of taunts and messages the user creates is shuffled through as they move, and then is chosen when the bound button is pressed.

# Why Is This Version 2.0?
My first Toxicity Randomizer was made fully in python and had slightly more customization, however the input listener was buggy and would not consistantly listen, often crashing or closing for seemingly no reason. Because of this I decided that it would be more intresting, consistent, and fun to make it within TF2s scripting language itself.

# Why Make This? Are You Stupid?
Yes. I'm also not entirely sure. I just like playing around with RNG and have a lot of unusual taunts. Before I knew it I was making version 1.0 for the hell of it, and over the last year its been constantly on my mind despite never using it, so I decided to finally buckle down and make version 2.0.
